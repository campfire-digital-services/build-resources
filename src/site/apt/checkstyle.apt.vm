Introduction

    This project contains a customised {{{http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net}Checkstyle}} configuration which attempts
    to walk the difficult line between "overly paranoid and won't even pass normal code" and "how the hell does this
    even work".

    The configuration discussed below is open to debate and discussion. If there is anything you feel particularly
    strongly about, {{{${project.issueManagement.url}}open a ticket}}.
